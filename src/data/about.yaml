  headline: Passion for Computer Science
  body: Hey there! I’m a computer science student from Malaysia. I became
    fascinated by how computers work when I was young. I’m always curious
    and thinking about the logic behind all of these, so I started by self
    learning during my secondary school years. Ever since, I’m pursuing my
    dream to become one of the best programmers out there.
